            <h3>Corpse Party</h3>
            <p>
              Monique worked with Syndromedia to bring an English speaking voice
              to characters 'Nana Ogasawara' and 'Antique Doll' in Corpse Party
              Extra Chapter 1, and Corpse Party Chapter 2.
            </p>
            <div class="div-p-img">
              <p>
                Nana Ogasawara is a student from Musashigawa Girl's Middle
                School, who found herself in a terrifying situation after
                performing a dangerous ritual. Monique strived to capture the
                sweet and kind nature of Nana's voice to bring some comfort and
                optimism to this quite spooky game.
              </p>

              <p>
                In contrast to this, the high-pitched creepy voice of the 'Antique
                Doll; is the last thing one would want to hear while walking
                through a haunted school. Monique was satisfied with her work when
                her cast mates listened to her performance as the Antique Doll and
                went 'screw that'.

              <p>
                Monique was excited to work with Divine W. to help bring the
                character '2-Bit' to life. She has so much fun participating in
                the kookiness of Cut Some Slack, and relates to the characters
                as they work their way through their young adult life.

            <h3>Please Don't Hate Christmas</h3>
            <p>
              Monique was happy to work with Syndromedia again, providing her
              voice for 'Mother' and other additional voices in Please Don't
              Hate Christmas (created by RiceLoveCoffee).

              She enjoys the uniqueness of this game and is entertained by the
              idea of playing the MC's mother. To each one of her friends who
              plays the game, she goes “I am your mother now.”
